## How to Use

Select some block of text in a `javascript` or `typescript` file and use `cmd+shift+p` to bring up the command palette, then select `Convert CSS-in-JS`.

Or use the keyboard shortcut `cmd+shift+j` (`ctrl+shift+j` on Windows).

# Thanks

Thanks to [Ansuman Shah](https://github.com/ansumanshah) for making [css-in-js](https://github.com/ansumanshah/css-in-js) for Atom. I basically copied what was done in that repo. ðŸ˜ƒ
